What are the trial objectives for clinical trial with number 1199.33?,['62adbfd9-67c6-519e-bcff-f05de0a31117'],The primary objective is to assess long term safety of treatment with oral nintedanib in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).
What is the selected dose for clinical trial with number 1199.33?,['de710e91-8998-566e-aa02-161fd0ac7429'],"Based on the phase II safety and dose-finding trial 1199.30, a dose of 150 mg bid was selected for confirmatory phase III trials (1199.32/.34) (U07-1248). With 150 mg bid, the limit of tolerability in IPF patients is considered to be reached. Lower doses may not ensure full efficacy benefit. However, in case of lack of tolerability, the dose may be reduced temporarily or permanently to 100 mg bid."
What is the treatment compliance for clinical trial with number 1199.33?,['0b56fe47-2377-5bbc-a628-4702ab2b2754'],"Study medication will be dispensed to the patient at the study site by responsible site personnel. Details regarding dispensing of the study medication to each participating patient, including patient identification, the amount of study drug dispensed, the date the drug was dispensed, and the number of capsules returned to the site will be recorded in the drug accountability form. Patients will be instructed to bring all study medication to the clinic at each visit (except Visits 3 and 5). The investigator will be responsible for the assessment of patient compliance and will be encouraged to counsel patients on the importance of taking study medication as directed at each visit. Study medication will be counted by the investigator (or designated site personnel) and compliance will be calculated in a worksheet, which must be kept as a source document. Compliance will be calculated according to the formula: Compliance (%) = Number of capsules actually taken since last count × 100 / Number of capsules which should have been taken in the same period. Compliance to nintedanib should be between 80% and 120%. Patients should not be discontinued for lack of compliance without prior discussion with the clinical monitor."

What is the storage strategy for clinical trial protocol DNDi-CH-E1224-003?,['3bd324b3-16bc-59c8-8e71-284aa5a65b65'],"Stability trials performed by Eisai showed that E1224 100-mg capsules were stable at 30°C/75% RH for 12 months and 40°C/75% RH for 6 months. Therefore, provisional shelf life for E1224 100-mg capsules is 24 months at controlled room temperature. The shelf life of the 100-mg capsules will be extended based on the results of future stability data. BZN tablets are stable at room temperature (15 ± 30o C). Therefore, the trial drug can be shipped at normal conditions and must be kept at room temperatures, at 30o C. The trial drugs must be kept in a locked room at each of the trial sites, with restricted access only by the authorized trial personnel and/or pharmacist. Site storage conditions and temperature must be monitored by the site personnel for adherence to product specifications. Records must be done at least once daily and kept in the investigator trial file or in the pharmacy file"

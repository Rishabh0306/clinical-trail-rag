What are the restrictions for clinical trials protocol CTJ301UC201?,['1fcbf72b-0236-58b6-a725-d4d8d02bf8f9'],"4.3.1 Prior and Concomitant Therapies
Details of all concomitant medication will be recorded in the e-CRF, along with the main reason for 
prescription. In addition, prior treatment for UC within 12 months of Visit 1 (Screening) will be 
recorded.
4.3.2 Prohibited Therapy
Patients will be prohibited from taking any other IMP or undergo any other investigative treatment 
during the trial from the time the informed consent form is signed through to at least the Follow-up 
Visit, or any other IMP within 30 days or 5 half-lives prior to Visit 2 (whichever is longer).
The following previous or concomitant medications are disallowed during the trial:
• Immunomodulating/suppressing drugs, including JAK inhibitors (NB: AZA and 6-MP are 
allowed as per inclusion criteria, see Section 4.1.1).
• Antibiotics, when given as treatment for UC relapse.
• Any biologic drugs.
• Any live (attenuated) vaccines.
4.3.3 Other Restrictions
Patients on stable-dose concomitant treatment for UC at Visit 2 must remain on a stable dose 
throughout the trial except for patients on corticosteroids; tapering of corticosteroids is allowed at 
the discretion of the Investigator",1.0,0.2,"According to the clinical trials protocol CTJ301UC201, the restrictions are as follows:

* Prior and concomitant therapies: Patients are prohibited from taking any other Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) or undergoing any other investigative treatment during the trial.
* Prohibited therapy: Patients are prohibited from taking immunomodulating/suppressing drugs, including JAK inhibitors, antibiotics when given as treatment for UC relapse, biologic drugs, and live (attenuated) vaccines.
* Other restrictions: Patients on stable-dose concomitant treatment for UC at Visit 2 must remain on a stable dose throughout the trial, except for patients on corticosteroids, who may taper their dose at the discretion of the Investigator.

These restrictions are intended to ensure the safety and efficacy of the trial and to minimize potential risks to patients.","['Date: 16 May 2017  \nVer.1. 1 \nSupersedes: Ver.1.0  \nPage 77 of 97 \n \n TJ301  Protocol No. : CTJ301UC201   \nSolution for Injection   \nClinical Trial Protocol  \nLeading Biopharm Limited   CONFIDENTIAL  14 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY ASPECTS  \n14.1 Independent Ethics Committee  \nAn IEC  will review the protocol and any amendments and advertisements used for recruitment.

In LaWin AmeUica, 21 coXnWUieV aUe endemic foU CD ZiWh an \nestimated 70 million people at risk of contracting the disease1. Estimates from the 1980s indicated \nthat some 16 million to 18 million individuals were infected. In the 1990s, after a series of multinational \ncontrol initiatives, estimates of the number of infected people were revised to 9.8 million in 2001. The \nestimated burden of disease in terms of disability -adjusted life years (DALYs) declined fr om 2.7 million \nin 1990 to 586,000 in 2001. Recent estimates from PAHO (2015) indicate about 6 million infected \npeople2 and 29,925  new cases of vector transmission per year.  \nThe current treatment for Chagas disease has significant limitations, including lo ng treatment \ndurations, safety and tolerability concerns and is currently limited to two nitro -heterocyclic drugs, \nnifurtimox and benznidazole (BZN).  BZN, a nitroimidazole introduced by Roche in 1971, is now \nmarketed by Laboratório Farmacêutico do Estado de Pernambuco S/A ± LAFEPE and Laboratorio \nELEA ± Argentina. It is supplied in tablets strengths of 12.5 mg, 50 and 100 mg and administered \ntwice daily at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight/day for adults and 5 -10 mg/kg body weight/day for \nchildren for 30 -60 da ys. Notably, the current regimens with BZN for the treatment of adults with CD \nlikely represent the maximum dosing case scenario in terms of dose, duration and schedule of \nadministration (Chagas expert meeting DNDi. January 2014. Geneva ). \nLack of convincin g and consistent data on efficacy and concerns about safety and tolerability \nprofiles have limited the widespread implementation of BZN treatments. Despite being available since \nthe early 70s, treatment recommendations vary significantly from country to co untry and the \ncomparative evidence -base with the current treatment regimens is limited.   \nDoses and duration of treatment for CD has not been evaluated systematically. Current \ntreatment regimens and dosing intervals have been derived from decades -old patien t series and with \nvery limited direct comparisons. Data from recently concluded trials  suggest existing opportunities for \noptimisation of BZN treatment regimens.  \nFrom 2011 to 2013, a DNDi -sponsored Phase 2, proof -of-concept clinical trial on E1224 and \nBZN in adults with chronic indeterminate CD was conducted in Bolivia assessing different dosing \nregimen of E1224 given for 4 to 8 weeks and benznidazole standard regi men against placebo. The \ntrial provided clear efficacy and safety information on the two compounds to support further clinical \ndevelopment and access3. After one week of treatment, mean qPCR repeated measures analyses \nshowed a significant difference in par asite load vs. placebo in all treatment arms. All BZN -treated \npatients had cleared parasite DNA after 2 weeks of treatment. At end -of treatment (EOT, Day 65), \nE1224 was found to be efficacious in clearing T. cruzi  parasites when compared to placebo. Six \nmonths after treatment, 22-33% of patients receiving E1224 low dose and short duration and 60% of \nthose receving high dose E1224 sustained parasite clearance compared with 95.6% of patients \ntreated with BZN  Of note, the large majority of treatment failures were identified up to  6 month follow -\nup visit.

In order to allow \nadministrative decisions, the results of the primary endpoint will be disclosed unblinded (by \ntreatment arm) to the Joint Development Committee. No individual patient data will be shared \nwith the Committee. In addition, data is to be shared with the Data Monitoring Committee.  \nThe Joint Development Committee is composed of the DNDi Project Leade r (DNDi \nHead of Chagas Program  or designated person ), DNDi Medical Director, and members from \nthe Eisai team. On occasion s the JDC meetings are attended by other members of staff from \nthese organisations. Under no circumstances will , the Principal Investig ator, trial site staff and \nstudy personnel from the Sponsor managing the trial have access to the results of the primary \nefficacy analysis prior to the end of the study. They will remain unequivocally blinded until \ncompletion of 12 months follow -up and fin al database lock.

Ethical aspects of trial treatments  \n \nClinical data  demonstrated  that E1224  has potential for the specific treatment of T. \ncruzi  infections  at EOT  and with a proportion of patients sustaining parasitological response \nuntil 6 months . Phase 1 trials  in healthy volunteers receiving E1224  suggest that the \ninvestigational drug has a satisfactory safety profile.  A Phase 1 drug -drug interaction trial which \nassessed the interaction of BNZ and E1224 showed that both compounds were well tolerated, \nin monotherapy and combination. The lack of clinically relevant safety findings provided \nsupport for follow -up evaluation of the two compounds in combinat ion. Likewise, experimental \ndata suggest a positive interaction between BZN and azole compounds for the treatment of \nChagas disease.  \n A placebo comparator has been selected for this trial. Due to the chronic nature of \nChagas Disease  and slow progression of organs impairment  there is no evidence of a \nsignificant risk for adult patient s recruited to the placebo group  within the timelines of trial \nevaluation . All patient s will be offered treatment at the end of the  trial. This arm will provide a \ncontrol for the therapeutic efficacy assessment of Benznidazole and BZN/E1224 alternative \nregimens . In addition , it will allow a more complete evaluation of PCR as an outcome measure \nfor CD clinical trials.  \n15.4.  Patient  costs  \nPatient s will be reimbursed for travel to and from the trial site and in case of any lost \nday(s) of work, but will not receive any payment for trial participation. Any  treatment for trial -\nrelated injuries  that is required during the trial period will be provided fr ee of charge to the \npatient .  \n16. INSURANCE AND LIABILITY  \nDNDi will provide insurance against claims arising from the trial, except for claims that \narise from malpractice and/or negligence. In addition, the DNDi will address the costs of \ntreatment of trial patient s in the event of trial -related injuries in accordance with the applicable \nregulatory requirements.  \n17.

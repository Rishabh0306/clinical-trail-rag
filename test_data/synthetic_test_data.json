Version  5.0.   \nConfidential  Page 10 of 87 \n PROTOCOL SUMMARY  \nProtocol Title   Double-blind, Double-dummy, Phase 2 Randomized, Multicenter, Proof- of-\nConcept, Safety and Efficacy Trial to Evaluate Different Oral Benznidazole \nMonotherapy and Benznidazole/E1224 Combination Regimens for the Treatment \nof Adult Patients with Chronic Indeterminate Chagas Disease \nPhase  Investigational \u00b1 Phase 2 trial  \nIndication  Chronic Indeterminate Chagas Disease  \nProtocol \nNumber DNDi- CH-E1224- 003 \nBackground \nInformation \nand Trial \nRationale The current treatment for Chagas disease has significant limitations, including long \ntreatment durations, safety and tolerability concerns and is currently limited to two \nnitro-heterocyclic drugs, nifurtimox and benznidazole (BZN).  BZN, a nitroimidazole \nintroduced by Roche in 1971, is marketed by Laborat\u00f3rio Farmac\u00eautico do Estado \nde Pernambuco S/A \u00b1 LAFEPE and Laboratorio ELEA \u00b1 Argentina. It is supplied \nin tablets strengths of 12.5, 50 and 100 mg, administered twice daily at a dose of  5 mg/kg body weight/day for adults and 5-10 mg/kg body weight/day for children \nfor 30-60 days. Notably, the current regimens with BZN for the treatment of adults \nwith CD likely represent the maximum dosing case scenario in terms of dose, \nduration and schedule of administration (Chagas expert meeting DNDi. January \n2014. GVA). \nDoses and duration of treatment for CD have not been evaluated systematically. Current treatment regimens and dosing intervals have been derived from decades-\nold patient series and with very limited direct comparisons. Data from recently concluded trials suggest existing opportunities for optimisation of the treatment \nregimens of BZN.  \nA DNDi -sponsored Phase 2, proof- of-concept clinical trial on E1224 and BZN in \nadults with chronic indeterminate CD, conducted between 2011 and 2013 in Bolivia, showed that all BZN-treated patients had cleared parasite DNA after 2 weeks of treatment and 81% sustained the parasite clearance at 12 months after \ntreatment. At end- of tre atment (EOT, Day 65), E1224 was found to be efficacious \nin clearing T. cruzi  parasites when compared to placebo. However, at 12 months \nless than one third of patients sustained parasite clearance. The trial safety data \nalso indicated a proportion of patients (10-20%) who do not complete treatment in \nconditions of use, the majority due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the long treatment duration. \nTaking into consideration the efficacy gap with about 80% sustained response and \na tolerability gap, with a proportion of patients (10-20%) who do not complete \ntreatment, two approaches for Chagas treatment optimization are to be pursued: \n1) A change in the current adult dosing regimen for BNZ to reduce exposure and \nimprove tolerability while maintaining efficacy; and \n2) The development of a combination therapy to improve efficacy while maintaining \nor improving tolerability. The combination therapy aims to address the efficacy gap \nand may or may not address tolerability gap. \n \nWith regards to the  dosing regimen, population-pharmacokinetics studies   \nobserved BZN plasma concentrations in children were significantly lower than \nthose previously reported in adults (treated with comparable mg/kg doses) . At the \nsame time, all children had parasite clearance, few adverse reactions to the drug. \nRecent population PK data in adults suggested that the current BZN dosing ",

Version  5.0.   \nConfidential  Page 11 of 87 \n regimen (2.5 mg/kg/12 h) may lead to overexposure in the majority of patients . \nDosing simulations suggested that a BNZ dose of 2.5 mg/kg/24 h would adequately \nkeep BNZ trough plasma concentrations within the recommended target range for \nthe majority of patients.  There are also opportunities for evaluation of fixed dose regimens for adult dosing, rather than mg/kg calculations, with increased ease- of-\nuse and potential for improved compliance in scaling up treatment of CD. Intermittent dosing regimens was also evaluated in murine model of chronic CD \nand in a pilot follow- up trial with 17 adult patients with chronic CD was, with similar \nparasitological cure rates to standard treatment. \nLikewise, several controlled observational trials with BZN, 5 mg/kg/day for 30 or 60 days have shown a reduction in the progression of heart disease serological and \nsero-negative conversion up to 60% in children and 30% in adults. Different \npublications showed anti-parasitic efficacy of treatment regimens with 30 and 60 \ndays, and of incomplete treatment of 10 days. Combination therapy is a well-\nrecognized treatment modality in many disease settings, including cancer , \ncardiovascular disease, and infectious diseases. Several infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, leprosy, and AIDS only came under control and were \neffectively treated after introduction of combinations of drugs that utilize different \nmechanisms of action. \nE1224 is a water-soluble monolysine salt form of the ravuconazole (RAV) pro-d rug \n(which is a phosphonooxymethyl ether derivative of RAV). It is a broad-spectrum \ntriazole antifungal. \n \nPooled safety data for the monolysine prodrug E1224 from Phase 1 and 2 trials \nindicated that E1224 was generally well tolerated and exhibited a safety profile \nquite similar to other azoles. Adverse events occurring in greater than 3% of E1224 recipients, with a dose-dependent pattern and at rates higher than those observed \nin placebo recipients included nausea, abnormalities in liver enzymes, dizziness, \nanxiety, and contact dermatitis. \nSafety evaluations indicated relatively mild, transient, and asymptomatic increases \nin liver enzymes \u00b1 completely reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Phase 1 \ncardiac safety evaluations showed that E1224 administration did not result in QTc \ninterval prolongation. \nExperimental data suggest a positive interaction between BZN and azole \ncompounds for the treatment of Chagas disease.\n18  \nA Phase 1 drug-drug interaction trial was designed to assess the pharmacokinetics \n(PK) and safety interaction of BNZ and E1224 co-administered daily for a total of \n54 days (Day 4 to Day 15- E1224 multiple dose 400 mg loading dose once daily \nfor 3 days, followed by maintenance dose 100mg once daily for 9 days (from Day 7 \nto Day 15); Day 9 BNZ single dose (2.5 mg/kg); and Day 12 to Day 15 BNZ multiple dose (2.5 mg/kg twice daily)).  The trial was conducted in Argentina and was concluded in early 2015, with enrolment of 28 healthy male volunteers . Both \ncompounds were well tolerated, in monotherapy and combination. There were no treatment discontinuations or serious adverse events. Transient, minor, non-\nconcomitant increase in bilirubin and liver transaminases occurred in 2 patients in \na pattern not suggestive of drug effect. There was no interaction of RAV on BNZ \nPK and the limited impact of BNZ on RAV PK, suggesting that co-administration of \nRAV and BNZ may not require any E1224 dosing adaptation. The lack of clinically \nrelevant safety findings provided support for follow-up evaluation of the two \ncompounds in combination. \nIn conclusion, recent scientific advances have provided further impetus to develop \nnew therapeutic approaches for CD using different doses and duration of BZN, as \nwell as combinations directed at multiple therapeutic targets to improve treatment response and tolerability and reduce the potential for development of resistance.  \nThis project focuses on the proof- of-concept evaluation of improved treatment ",

BACKGROUND AND TRIAL  RATIONALE  \nChagas disease (CD) is a disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) , ranking among \nWhe ZoUld\u00b6V moVW neglecWed diVeaVeV. In LaWin AmeUica, 21 coXnWUieV aUe endemic foU CD ZiWh an \nestimated 70 million people at risk of contracting the disease1. Estimates from the 1980s indicated \nthat some 16 million to 18 million individuals were infected. In the 1990s, after a series of multinational \ncontrol initiatives, estimates of the number of infected people were revised to 9.8 million in 2001. The \nestimated burden of disease in terms of disability -adjusted life years (DALYs) declined fr om 2.7 million \nin 1990 to 586,000 in 2001. Recent estimates from PAHO (2015) indicate about 6 million infected \npeople2 and 29,925  new cases of vector transmission per year.  \nThe current treatment for Chagas disease has significant limitations, including lo ng treatment \ndurations, safety and tolerability concerns and is currently limited to two nitro -heterocyclic drugs, \nnifurtimox and benznidazole (BZN).  BZN, a nitroimidazole introduced by Roche in 1971, is now \nmarketed by Laborat\u00f3rio Farmac\u00eautico do Estado de Pernambuco S/A \u00b1 LAFEPE and Laboratorio \nELEA \u00b1 Argentina. It is supplied in tablets strengths of 12.5 mg, 50 and 100 mg and administered \ntwice daily at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight/day for adults and 5 -10 mg/kg body weight/day for \nchildren for 30 -60 da ys. Notably, the current regimens with BZN for the treatment of adults with CD \nlikely represent the maximum dosing case scenario in terms of dose, duration and schedule of \nadministration (Chagas expert meeting DNDi. January 2014. Geneva ). \nLack of convincin g and consistent data on efficacy and concerns about safety and tolerability \nprofiles have limited the widespread implementation of BZN treatments. Despite being available since \nthe early 70s, treatment recommendations vary significantly from country to co untry and the \ncomparative evidence -base with the current treatment regimens is limited.   \nDoses and duration of treatment for CD has not been evaluated systematically. Current \ntreatment regimens and dosing intervals have been derived from decades -old patien t series and with \nvery limited direct comparisons. Data from recently concluded trials  suggest existing opportunities for \noptimisation of BZN treatment regimens.  \nFrom 2011 to 2013, a DNDi -sponsored Phase 2, proof -of-concept clinical trial on E1224 and \nBZN in adults with chronic indeterminate CD was conducted in Bolivia assessing different dosing \nregimen of E1224 given for 4 to 8 weeks and benznidazole standard regi men against placebo. The \ntrial provided clear efficacy and safety information on the two compounds to support further clinical \ndevelopment and access3. After one week of treatment, mean qPCR repeated measures analyses \nshowed a significant difference in par asite load vs. placebo in all treatment arms. All BZN -treated \npatients had cleared parasite DNA after 2 weeks of treatment. At end -of treatment (EOT, Day 65), \nE1224 was found to be efficacious in clearing T. cruzi  parasites when compared to placebo. Six \nmonths after treatment, 22-33% of patients receiving E1224 low dose and short duration and 60% of \nthose receving high dose E1224 sustained parasite clearance compared with 95.6% of patients \ntreated with BZN  Of note, the large majority of treatment failures were identified up to  6 month follow -\nup visit.

Version  5.0.   \nConfidential  Page 24 of 87 \n Although E1224 was found to have limited efficacy as a single -treatment agent, it holds \npromise for use in combination with existing drugs, since it showed s trong positive activity during \ntreatment, with a third of patients having a sustained treatment response at the higher dose.  \nSafety analyses showed that the most common BZN related AEs were nausea (20%), \ndermatologic AEs (11.1%), hypersensitivity reaction s (24.4%), headache (24.4%), and neuropathy \n(11.1%), with a time -course pattern for development of treatment emergent adverse events. Gastro -\nintestinal disturbances and hypersensitivity reactions were the first to occur, followed by liver enzyme \nabnormalit ies, while most cases of neuropathy occurred after 30 days of treatment.  Around 9% of \npatients in the BZN arm had elevated transaminases and hypersensitivity reactions leading to \ntreatment discontinuation. In the E1224 treatment groups, there was a dose -dependent increase in \nAEs, including headache (24.4%), nausea (15.6%) and liver enzyme elevations (ALT (22.2%) and \nAST (17.8%).  \nThese data suggest that BZN is rapidly effective, however there is both an efficacy gap with \nabout 80% sustained response at 12 m onths and a tolerability gap, with a proportion of patients (10-\n20%) who do not complete treatment in conditions of use, the majority due to adverse drug reactions \n(ADRs) and the long treatment duration (see Figure 1).  \n \nFigure 1: Current treatment for Chag as with BNZ  \n \nBetween April 2008 and November 2010 a prospective population -pharmacokinetics cohort \ntrial4 condXcWed aW Whe PaUaViWolog\\ and ChagaV SeUYice, BXenoV AiUeV ChildUen\u00b6V HoVSiWal \u00b5\u00b5R \nGXWieUUe]\u00b6\u00b6 enUolled 40 childUen beWZeen 2 and 12 \\eaUV of age ZiWh  CD.

Dosing simulations suggested that a BNZ dose of 2.5 \nmg/kg/24 h would adequately keep BNZ trough plasma concentrations within the recommended target \nrange for the majority of patients6.  There are also opportunities for evaluation of fixed dose regimens \nfor adult dosing, rather than mg/kg calculations, with increased ease -of-use and po tential for improved \ncompliance in scaling up treatment of CD.  \nLikewise, several controlled observational trials  with BZN, 5 mg/kg/day for 30 or 60 days \nhave shown a reduction in the progression of heart disease serological and sero -negative conversion \nup to 60% in children and 30% in adults7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Different publications showed anti -parasitic \nefficacy of treatment regimens with 30 and 60 days14,15 and of incomplete treatment of 10 days16.  \nAdditional experimental data suggest other opportunities for alternative dosing regimens of \nBZN. Bustamante et al. showed that intermittent BZN administration had similar parasitological cure \nrates to standard treatment, in a stringent murine model of chro nic CD 17. A pilot follow -up trial was \nconducted in Argentina by Viotti, Sosa -Estani, and colleagues to evaluate a BZN treatment regimen \nwith intermittent doses of 5 mg/kg/day, taken at 5 -day intervals, during 60 days in 17 adult patients \nwith chronic CD. P reliminary results show a high proportion of end of treatment clearance of \nparasitemia with this regimen, in line with historical data on standard BZN treatment.  \nTaking into consideration these results, two approaches for Chagas treatment optimization \nare to be pursued (Figure 2): 1) Changing current adult dosing regimen for BNZ to reduce exposure \nand improve tolerability while maintaining efficacy; and, 2) Development of a combination therapy to \nimprove efficacy while maintaining or improving tolerability.  The former does not address the existing \nefficacy gap. Combination therapy aims to address the efficacy gap and may or may not address \ntolerability gap.  \n \nFigure 2: Options for improving current treatment  \n \n  \nThe causative agent of CD, T. cruzi,  has been c alled Whe \u00b3cUX]i comSle[\u00b4 becaXVe of Whe \nconsiderable genetic polymorphism observed between parasite populations.

Drug susceptibility varies \nwidely depending upon direct typing units (DTUs), geographic location, host factors, and prior therapy \nused.  \nTreatment of virtually every infectious dise ase begins with empiric therapy intended to cover \nthe broadest possible spectrum of pathogens likely to cause the infection. Therapy is then narrowed \nonce the etiologic pathogen is identified and the drug susceptibility pattern is determined.  \nIn routine t reatment of chronic indeterminate CD, identification of the specific etiologic \npathogen is almost never possible. Also,  there is evidence that more than one parasite lineage can \ncause an infection in a single patient.  \nCombination therapy is a well -recogni zed treatment modality in many disease settings, \nincluding cancer, cardiovascular disease, and infectious diseases. Several infectious diseases. such \nas tuberculosis, malaria, leprosy, and AIDS, only came under control and were effectively treated only \nafter introduction of combinations of drugs that utilize different mechanisms of action.  \nE1224 is a water -soluble monolysine salt form of the ravuconazole (RAV) pro -drug (which is \na phosphonooxymethyl ether derivative of RAV). It is a broad -spectrum triazole antifungal. RAV was \nevaluated extensively in animal models and in human trials including Phase 2 safety and efficacy \ntrials in oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis and onychomycosis, and for prevention of \ninvasive fungal infections in hematopoietic ste m cell transplant recipients.  \n E1224 is rapidly converted to RAV in vivo: data from both preclinical and clinical evaluations \nof RAV are therefore considered relevant to E1224. E1224 is available as oral formulations (100 \ncapsules). It has completed gener al toxicology and safety pharmacology trials , as well as five Phase \n1 clinical trials : ascending, single and multiple loading and maintenance dose, bioavailability, and \nfood-effect trial; ascending, multiple loading and maintenance dose trial of E1224 administered \nintravenously over 14 days; effect of E1224 on cytochrome P450 enzymes; and cardiac \nsafety/thorough QTc trial.  \nPharmacokinetic trials  showed that E1224 is rapidly converted to RAV with a peak \nconcentration at 2.5 to 6 hours post -dose with a long terminal half -life of 7.7 to 10.5 days. RAV \naccumulated over time (AUC on Day 1 < Day 7 and 14). With a loading and maintenance dose \nstrategy, a steady state level at desired peak concentrations of RAV can be achieved within 7 days \nof initial  dosing.   \nSafety evaluations indicated relatively mild, transient, and asymptomatic increases in liver \nenzymes \u00b1 completely reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Phase 1 cardiac safety evaluations \nshowed that E1224 administration did not result in Q Tc interval prolongation. Mean QTcF interval was \nshortened compared to baseline, with peak effect on QTc interval at 1 and 1.5 hours post -dosing and \nmean change from baseline of -16.9 to -19.4 msec. QT remained within normal limits and there was \nno dose -response relationship to these changes at steady -state. Findings resolved spontaneously by \n4 hours after dosing.

There were no changes in clinical signs, body \nweight, food consumption, ophthalmoscopy, or urinalysis. There were increased adrenal weights in \nfemales at \u226530 mg/kg, increased  adrenal vacuolation of cortical cells in both sexes at \u226530 mg/kg, \nand decreased triglycerides in males at 60 mg/kg. Based on these results, the NOAEL was considered \nto be 10 mg/kg.  \n\u25cf Results from the 39 -week toxicity study in monkeys with ravuconazole dos es of 1 to 30 \nmg/kg revealed no death or moribundity related to the test article. No changes were observed in \nclinical signs or food consumption, though one male monkey in the 30 mg/kg dose group \ndemonstrated gradual body weight decrease throughout the dos ing period ( -11%, vs pre -dosing). \nThere were no changes in ophthalmoscopy, ECG, urinalysis, or hematology measurements. Gross \nfindings showed enlarged liver and adrenals. The histopathological changes in liver appeared to be \nrelated to adaptive hepatocellu lar hypertrophy. These findings were comparable to those observed in \nthe previous 4 - and 13 -week toxicity studies at doses of 5 and 30 mg/kg. These were adaptive \nchanges related to hepatic enzyme induction, and no evidence of progression or increased sever ity \nwas observed after 39 weeks of administration.

Using a rapid treatment protocol for 7 \ndays, the combined treatments were more efficacious in reducing paras itemia levels than the drugs \ngiven alone, with the effects most evident in combinations of sub -optimal doses of the drugs.

Similar results were seen with combination treatment of E1224 and \nBZN in T.cruzi  murine infection22. \nA Phase 1 drug -drug interaction trial was designed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and \nsafety interaction of BNZ and E1224 co -administered daily for a total of 54 days (Day 4 to Day 15) \nE1224 multiple dose 400  mg loading dose once daily for 3 days, followed by maintenance dose 100 \nmg once  daily for 9 days (from Day  7 to Day  15); Day 9 BNZ single dose (2.5 mg/kg); and Day 12 to \nDay 15  BNZ multiple dose (2.5 mg/kg twice daily).   The trial was conducted in Argentina and was \nconcluded in early 2015, with enrolment of 28 healthy male volunteers . Both compounds were well \ntolerated, in monotherapy and combination. There were no treatment discontinuations or serious \nadverse events. Transient, minor, non -concomitant increase in bilirubin and liver transaminases \noccurred in 2 patients in a pattern no t suggestive of drug effect. There was no interaction of RAV on \nBNZ PK and the limited impact of BNZ on RAV PK, suggesting that co -administration of RAV and \nBNZ may not require any E1224 dosing adaptation. The lack of clinically relevant safety findings \nprovided support for follow -up evaluation of the two compounds in combination.  \nIn conclusion, recent scientific advances have provided further impetus to develop new \ntherapeutic approaches for CD using different doses and duration of BZN, as well as combinat ions \ndirected at multiple therapeutic targets to improve treatment response and tolerability and reduce the \npotential for development of resistance.  \nThis project focuses on the proof -of-concept evaluation of improved treatment regimens of \nBZN, with the assessment of new BZN -sparing regimens in monotherapy and in combination with \nE1224.  \n \n2.

However, \nthe total trial duration is estimated to be 28 months, from start -up phase to final trial report.  \n \n3.3. Rationale of trial design  \n \nThe selection of a placebo -controlled Phase 2 clinical trial design was based on the \nrequirements for well -controlled proof -of-concept, efficacy and safety data for Benznidazole and \nBeznnidazole/E1224  for this therapeutic indication.  \nThe choice of the CD target population was largely driven by the unmet medical need for \na new, safe and effective treatment for chronic indeterminate CD. Adults with chronic \nindeterminate CD are recognized as the population with the most urgent requirements for the \ndevelopment of new treatments.  Drugs employed in children, with acute and early chronic CD \nare more often efficacious and better tolerated, with less than 10% of patients presenting serious \nadverse events.   \nMoreover, with a decreasing incidence and existi ng patterns of disease presentation, the \nhighest disease burden is found in patients in the chronic indeterminate phase of the disease.  \nCD is seldom diagnosed in the acute phase, with circulating parasites identifiable by optical \nmicroscopy, with the exce ption of congenital cases, immunosuppressed patients and the small \nclusters of oral transmission.  Carrying out rigorous clinical trials in any of these populations would \npresent ethical and logistical challenges (in light of high response rates to benznid azole in \ncongenital disease), confounding elements (due to the severity of disease and need for frequent \nconcomitant medications in the case of immunosuppressed patients) and feasibility issues (due \nto the small numbers and dispersed nature of most cluster s of oral transmission in the Amazon \nregion).  \nThe efficacy of this indication will be assessed through sustained parasitological response \nover six months measured by serial negative qualitative PCRs as the primary endpoint. Clinical \nCD related events occur at a low incidence in this population and would thus require very large \nclinical trials to assess incidence changes and serological endpoints would require several y ears \nto decades in chronic CD. Recently concluded clinical trials provide support for the selected \nendpoint and timelines for assessment  in proof -of-concept . \nThe secondary endpoints will assess the sustained parasitemia at 12 months and the time \nto clearan ce of parasitemia by serial ne gative qualitative PCR results , comparing each of the six \ndosing regimens relative to placebo, notably assessment of parasite load over time, conventional \nand non-conventional serology . Parasite clearance data will  be correlated with pharmacokinetic \nparameters.  \nThe evaluation of cure is considered to be the most complex aspect of treatment \nassessment in CD.  Parasitological cure is difficult to interpret and its evaluation is challenging in ",

Version  5.0.   \nConfidential  Page 33 of 87 \n light of the need for tot al elimination of parasites, not only from the blood but also from tissues \nwhere it is not measurable.  Assessment of parasitological cure requires long -term follow -up \nbecause of the pathogenesis and hysteresis of the disease, the characteristics of the pa rasite, \nthe host response times, and the consequent clinical manifestations.  Such changes occur over \nlong periods of time.   \nA negative direct blood smear at the end of treatment is generally accepted as evidence \nof a favorable  response in acute CD patien ts. In chronic disease, serial hemocultures, \nxenodiagnosis, or PCR have been used to support the serological assessment, and a positive \nparasitological diagnostic test result indicates treatment failure.  Hemoculture and xenodiagnosis \nare techniques that re quire proper resources/infrastructure and very ski llful and experienced \npersonnel to adequately perform them. With regard to conventional serology, for chronic \nindeterminate CD patients, seroconversion to negative would occur after 5 to 10 years (although \ncases with a longer period for conversion to negative have been described). Therefore, for the \npurposes of clinical development and proof -of-concept, it has been proposed that qualitative and \nquantitative PCR parasitological tests be used as markers for ef ficacy in clinical trials  of chronic \nindeterminate CD.   \nImportant considerations have included the significant variability in the clinical sensitivity \nand specificity of PCR tests observed in early published trials , with differences seen across all \nphases  of the disease and across a number of techniques in use that require standardization.  In \nparticular, there has been concern regarding the sensitivity of PCR in chronic CD due to low \nlevels of circulating parasites and natural fluctuations in parasitemia.  In a recent comparison of \ntwo diagnostic techniques in patients with chronic CD, PCR had high specificity (100%) and \nmoderate sensitivity (70% to 75%).  \nThe latest PCR trials  have shown higher sensitivity, with a broad dynamic range for PCR \nuse allowing di rect measurements in cases with high parasitic loads such as in \nimmunosuppressed CD patients and congenitally infected newborns, as well as in cases with low \nparasitic loads, such as patients in the chronic indeterminate phase or who are receiving \nantipara sitic treatment.  \nAn important advance in recent years has been the trial sponsored by UNICEF/UNDP/ \nWorld Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) for \nthe standardization and laboratory validation of qualitative PCR te sting for T. cruzi .  Standardized \nprocedures for the qualitative assessment of PCR (standard and real -time) testing with higher \nanalytical sensitivity and specificity, reproducibility, and low levels of intra - and inter -assay \nvariation and high levels of a ccuracy have been selected.    \nDuring expert panel discussions and with support from recent data on DNDi sponsored \ntrials , there is consensus on the value of using serial, sequential blood collections for qualitative \nand quantitative PCR assays in order to increase PCR test sensitivity and evaluate durability of \nresponse.  The proposed trial will incorporate the standardized  and optimi zed procedures for ",

Written approval from all involved IECs must be obtained before implementation \nof any protocol -specified intervention /investigation provided to the patient . \nAny modifications made to the protocol after receipt of the IEC approval must also be \nsubmitted by the investigator  in writing to the IEC in accordance with local procedures and \nregulatory requirements.  \n15.1.  Informed consent process  \nInclusion in the trial will occur only if the patient  gives written informed consent. It is \nthe responsibility of the investigator/designee to obtain voluntary written informed consent from \neach individual participating in this trial, after adequate presentation of aims, methods, \nanticipated benefits, and po tential hazards of the trial. The written informed consent document \nwill be translated into the local language or a language understood by the patient  (s). The \npatient  will be given time to discuss the information received with members of the community \nor family before deciding to consent. The patient  will be asked to provide written and signed \nconsent.  \nIf the patient  is illiterate  or unable to write , s/he will include a mark in the form and a \nliterate witness must sign (this person should have no connectio n to the research team  and \nthe sponsor , and, if possible, should be selected by the participant).  \nIf new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, \nthe consent form should be reviewed and updated if necessary. All patients (including those \nalready being treated) should be informed of the new information, given a copy of the revised \nform and give their consent to continue in the trial.  \n15.2.  Ethical aspects of patient  inclusion and trial procedures  \n \nOnly eligible  patient s for Chagas therapy according to national guidelines and for \nwhom Benznidazole standard treatment is indicated will be enrolled in this trial. The \nmanagement of their disease and therapy will follow national guidelines. In comparison with \ncurrent BZN stand ard treatment, the new therapeutic approaches for CD using different doses \nand duration of BZN, as well as combinations , target an improve ment in  treatment response \nand tolerability and reduce the potential for development of resistance . \nParticipants  on this trial may experience discomfort during examination and blood \nsampling.

The maximal quantity during 1 visit is 28mL \n(equivalent to 2  table spoons).  \n15.3.  Ethical aspects of trial treatments  \n \nClinical data  demonstrated  that E1224  has potential for the specific treatment of T. \ncruzi  infections  at EOT  and with a proportion of patients sustaining parasitological response \nuntil 6 months . Phase 1 trials  in healthy volunteers receiving E1224  suggest that the \ninvestigational drug has a satisfactory safety profile.  A Phase 1 drug -drug interaction trial which \nassessed the interaction of BNZ and E1224 showed that both compounds were well tolerated, \nin monotherapy and combination. The lack of clinically relevant safety findings provided \nsupport for follow -up evaluation of the two compounds in combinat ion. Likewise, experimental \ndata suggest a positive interaction between BZN and azole compounds for the treatment of \nChagas disease.  \n A placebo comparator has been selected for this trial. Due to the chronic nature of \nChagas Disease  and slow progression of organs impairment  there is no evidence of a \nsignificant risk for adult patient s recruited to the placebo group  within the timelines of trial \nevaluation . All patient s will be offered treatment at the end of the  trial. This arm will provide a \ncontrol for the therapeutic efficacy assessment of Benznidazole and BZN/E1224 alternative \nregimens . In addition , it will allow a more complete evaluation of PCR as an outcome measure \nfor CD clinical trials.  \n15.4.  Patient  costs  \nPatient s will be reimbursed for travel to and from the trial site and in case of any lost \nday(s) of work, but will not receive any payment for trial participation.

In addition, the DNDi will address the costs of \ntreatment of trial patient s in the event of trial -related injuries in accordance with the applicable \nregulatory requirements.  \n17.

IL-6 is believed to be a key mediator in \ndiseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  (RA), psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; i.e. \nCrohn\u2019s disease and ulce rative colitis [UC]).  \nIL-6 exerts its multiple biological activities through two main signalling pathways. One is the so-\ncalled classic ligand -receptor pathway via membrane- bound IL -6 receptors (IL -6R) present mainly \non hepatocytes and certain leukocytes. The second is the trans -signa lling pathway via circulating \nsoluble IL -6R (sIL -6R) originating from proteolytic cleavage of the membrane -bound IL 6R or \nfrom alternative splicing (1)(2) . While the classic IL -6 signal ling is involved in the acute \ninflammatory response, trans -signa lling is mainly involved in chronic inflammation and has been \nshown to prevent disease-promoting mucosal T-cell populations from going into apoptosis. A schematic presentation of the trans -signalling pathway of IL -6 is shown in Figure 1 . \n \nTACE: tumour  necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme  \nADAM: A disintegrin and metalloprotease \nFigure 1 Trans -signalling Pathway of IL-6  \nPatient s with Crohn\u2019s disease and UC have been found to produce increased levels of IL- 6 when \ncompared with controls, the IL- 6 levels being correlated to clinical activity (3)(4)( 5)(6) . Crohn\u2019s \ndisease and UC patient s have also been found to have increased levels of sIL-6R and consequently, \nIL 6/sIL -6R complex in serum  (4)(5)(6). \nTJ301 (FE 999301, Olamkicept (proposed INN)) is a first -in-class, selective I L-6 trans- signalling \ninhibitor and anti- inflammatory biologic that is under development for the treatment of UC and \nCrohn\u2019s disease. TJ301 is a selective IL -6/sIL -6R complex trap consisting of two complete \nextracellular domains of gp130, the common signal transducer of IL-6-type cytokines, dimerised by \n",

TJ301 \nis expected to be as effective as existing biologics but safer and more suited for early and long-term \nuse. \n1.2 Scientific Justification for Conducting the Trial  \nThe safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of T J301 (FE 999301)  have been \ninvestigated in Germany  in two phase  1, single - and multiple -ascending dose clinical studies in \nhealthy and Crohn\u2019 s disease  subjects with up to 4 weeks of weekly intravenous (i.v.) infusion. \nThese studies showed dose -proportional  systemic exposure, in the dose range of 0.75 mg to 750 mg, \nwith a mean terminal half -life of approximately 5  days and no apparent dose -dependent trends in \nthe incidence or nature of adverse events. Furthermore, a cohort of patients with quiescent Crohn\u2019s \ndisease demonstrated similar systemic exposure to that in healthy subjects, for corresponding doses \nof 75 mg, 300 mg, and 750 mg in the single -ascending -dose trial.  \nThe purpose of this proof -of-concept trial is to assess the safety , efficacy, tolerability, \npharmacokinetics (PK)  and pharmacodynamics (PD) of two  different doses of i.v. infusions of \nTJ301 in patients with active UC. The ability to induce remission of TJ301 will be investigated in the 12- week double -blind treatment perio d of the study .  \n1.3 Benefit / Risk Aspects  \nFor patients with active UC, 5 -aminosalicylate (5 -ASA) is considered a first -line treatment, either \nas oral or topical (e.g. suppositories, enema) formulations. 5- ASA has a benign safety profile with \ndosing in active  disease of up to several grams a day, but is not effective in all patients.  \nOral, systemic corticosteroids are used for induction of remission in patients not responding to \n5-ASA. Corticosteroids have frequent and occasionally serious side effects, e.g. hypothalamic -\npituitary -adrenal  (HPA) -axis suppression, hyperglycaemia/insulin resistance, cataracts, and \nosteoporosis (notably, IBD itself is a risk factor for osteopenia/osteoporosis, with Crohn\u2019s patients \nbeing most affected), and systemic corticosteroid s are therefore undesirable in maintenance \ntreatment. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine (AZA) or 6 -mercaptopurine  (6-MP) (i.e. \nthiopurines), are used as steroid- sparing agents in steroid- dependent or steroid- refractory patients, \nin induction as  well as maintenance treatment ( 7)(8), but are associated with an increased risk for \nmalignancies  (9). Since thiopurines  and corticosteroids are not effective in all patients and \nespecially in the moderately to severely active IBD patient population, there is a need for novel, effective and safe second - and even  third -line treatment options.   \nIn conclusion, patients with ac tive UC are representative of the target population for TJ301, and \nshould present the opportunity to detect a larger effect due to more pronounced disease activity at \nBaseline .

The SRC will review blinded data and provide recommendations to the S ponsor \nbased on their evaluation. \nDuring the conduct of the trial, the responsibilities of the SRC will b e to periodically review safety \ndata, evaluate any safety concerns, and  make recommendations to the Sponsor regarding trial \nconduct and possible trial modifications. The SRC  will comprise at least a medical monitor, a \nphysician  and a pharmacologist .

The \ncharter will outline the specific purpose and functions of the SRC- related to monitoring the safety \nof patients in the tria l. This charter will also describe the pro cedures for data extraction and data \ndelivery conventions to and from the SRC members for review purposes. \n3.4 Discussion of Overall Trial Design  \n3.4.1 Trial Design \nThis trial is designed as a randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled proof -of-concept trial of \nTJ301. Patients will be on concomitant treatment with stable doses of corticosteroids, or  \nimmunomodulators, or 5- ASA/sulfasalazine  \u2013 all first-  or second -line standard of care in UC \u2013 for \nat least the duration of the 12- week Treatment Period (i .e. up to the  primary endpoint) . Two  dose  \nlevel s of TJ301 will be investigated, and as discussed in Section  3.4.4, modelling of the effect on a \nPD biomarker, based on PK measurements over a wide range of serum  concentrations  of TJ301, \nsuggests that the chosen dosages may show a dose -dependent clinical ef ficacy.  \nThe typical duration of induction treatment in active UC, both in clinical practice and in clinical \ntrials, is at least 8  weeks. The novel mechanism of action with TJ301, with blockade of only IL -6 \ntrans -signalling,  may influence the time to a clinically relevant endpoint such as clinical remission. \nIn order to capture the full extent of the potential treatment effect, the primary endpoint will be \nassessed at Week 12. As shown in the recent proof -of-concept trial with etrolizumab (10) in a ",

Thus, more substantive \u2018true\u2019 response \nand remission rates can be expected with longer treatment duration.  \n3.4.2 Selection of Endpoints  \nThe prospectively define d primary efficacy endpoint will be a binary endpoint of clinical and \nendoscopic remission at Week 12, defined as a full Mayo score \u22642, no individual subscore >1 , and \nrectal bleeding subscore = 0 . The full Mayo score (range, 0 -12; higher score is worse) is  based on \nthe clinician\u2019s scoring of clinical signs and symptoms, as well as endoscopic scoring of gross \ncolonic mucosal inflammation. While there is no validated scale for scoring  the severity of \ninflammation o r clinical symptoms in UC, the Mayo score has  been extensively used in earlier \nclinical trials in UC, and shows a good correlation between the full Mayo score and the clinician-\nrated components only (partial Mayo score  without endoscopy ; see Section  7.1.1 for details). The \npartial Mayo score without endoscopy  can be used to accurately predict inflammatory activity , and \nthe evolution of a treatment effect  even in the absence of endoscopy .  \nNevert heless, the endoscopic component of the Mayo score allows a direct assessment of the \ninflammatory activity, which is suitable in a proof -of-concept  setting. This should allow a more \nrobust correlation between clinical efficacy outcomes, PK parameters, and PD effects.  \n3.4.3 Blinding  \nA central , computer -based  randomisation procedure is used to eliminate selection bias. To reduce \nthe risk of breaking the blind, IMP thawing and reconstitution will be car ried out at the trial site by \nblinded site person nel, independent of the Investigator and the Sponsor . The appearance of the \nreconstituted IMP, as well as the infusion volume ( 290 mL) will be identical for all treatment \ngroups.  \nIn order to reduce bias as much as possible, the trial is  double -blind, keeping all subjects  and the  \ninvestigator blinded to the treatment.  The randomisation list will not be available to any person \ninvolved in the conduct and evaluation of the trial until the trial database is locked .  \n3.4.4 Selection of Doses in the Trial  \nThe safety and tolerability of TJ301 have  been investigated in phase 1, single - and multiple -\nascending dose studies in both healthy subjects and patients with quiescent IBD ( Crohn's disease ) \nup to 750 mg without any concern. Pharmacokinetic results indicate dose proportionality in maximal concentration obtained (C\nmax) and overall exposure (AUC) with a terminal half -life of \napproximately 4.7 days.  \nThe doses and dose frequency selected for this trial are within a dose range that is considered safe \nand tolerable in healthy subjects an d patients, trying to limit the number of i.v. infusion events.  \nEvidence from treatment with infliximab and etanercept indicate that a higher dose requirement in IBD compared to RA and psoriasis and may also vary between disease states.

Mucosal T -cells from IBD patients have showed strong evidence for IL -6 trans -\nsignalling with activation of STAT -3, and the anti -apoptotic factors bcl -2 and bcl -xl. Treatment \nwith TJ301 is anticipated to induce apoptosis of disease -perpetuating T -cells (12), which are \nassumed to induce long -lasting secretion of matrix -degrading substances such as chemokines and \nmatrix metalloproteinases, which promote transmural inflammation. The turnover of T -cells may \ninfluence the dosing frequency. Treatments of IBD patients normally employ a less frequent or \nlower dose , when clinical remission is achieved.  \nThe activity of the drug has, in the phase 1 program me, been explored using an ex vivo  assay \nmeasuring the level of activation (phosphorylation) of the second messenger STAT -3. The \nrelationship between exposure ( Figure 3 a) and efficacy  is not known. Howe ver, based on ex vivo  \nexperiments, target saturation  resulting in a suppression of STAT -3 activation back to baseline \nlevels  is expected to occur above an exposure of 1 \u00b5g/mL. Thus, the dose levels for this trial were \nselected to test levels of exposure around the threshold. \nThe 75 mg dose every other week is, according to simulations, anticipated to suppress the second \nmesseng er signal to baseline level for a duration of at least one week and single dose data suggest \napproximately 80% occupancy after 14 days (Figure 3 b). Both the 300 mg and 600 mg dose \nadministered every other week are anticipated to suppress the activation of the IL -6/sIL -6R second \nmessenger signal STAT -3 to baseline, as the trough levels are expected to be >1 \u00b5g/mL.  The \nhighest dose of 600 mg is selected t o likely cover the highest anticipated dose in the therapeutic \nrange of TJ301.  ",

In this study, TJ301 will be administered \nat up to 600 mg every two weeks for 12 consecutive weeks (6 doses totally). The concentration -\ntime curves from the phase I study indicated very limited accumulation of TJ301 in plasma after \nmultiple dosing. Although there will be 2 more doses in this study compared with the phase I study, \nthe averaged plasma concentration of TJ301 will be very similar  between the two studies. Therefore \nthe proposed maximum doses (600 mg Q2W) can be considered safe and tolerable in patients.

The overall range  of the full Mayo score is 0- 12 (higher scores being worse) and e ach \nsubscore has a range of 0 -3 (Table 2 ). The scores  for stool frequency and rectal bleeding will be \ncalculated as an average based on scores collected from the Patient daily Diary , for up to 5, but at \nleast 3  days prior to each applicable visit . If the patient undergoes bowel preparation for endoscopy \nany of the days before a visit, the stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscore for that day(s) \nshould be considered missing . In addition, the stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscore will be \nconsidered missing for the day of all endoscopies and the day after. The physician\u2019s global \nassessment and endoscopic appearance scores will be collected in the e- CRF.  \nThe prospectively defined primary efficacy variable of clinical and endoscopic remission ( defined \nas a full Mayo score \u22642, no individual subscore >1, rectal bleeding subscore = 0 ), will be used and \nis in accordance with guidelines and literature ( 14) (15) . \nThe 9 -point partial Mayo score, defined here as the sum of the stool freque ncy, rectal bleeding, and \nphysician\u2019s global assessment subscores (range 0 -9; higher scores being worse) is used for efficacy \nassessment at all site visits starting at Visit 2. The secondary endpoints based on the 9 -point partial \nMayo score which correlates well with the full Mayo score (16), should accurately predict the \nevolution of the effect on mucosal inflammation even in the absence of endoscop y at most site \nvisits. Lastly, for the purpose of analysing patient -reported symptoms only, the 6- point partial \nMayo score, defined as the sum of the stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores (range 0 -6; \nhigher scores being worse) will be employed.  \nIn parallel to the investigator scoring, endoscopic scoring (endoscopic component of the Mayo \nscore) will be performed through centralised reading for efficacy assessment.  Investigator \nevaluation must be verified by blinded central reader, with a second blinded central reader in case of lack of agreement.  Note that the criteria of endoscopic appearance assessment in this study are \nDIFFERENT from the original criteria  in (13). \nThe Endoscopy subscore is modified so that a value of \n1 does not include friability.  Personnel responsible  for endoscopic evaluation should NOT refer to \nthe original criteria . \nThe endoscop y completed at Screening  and Visit 8 ( Week 12) will be sent to a central reading \ncenter  selected by the Sponsor. The central read ing center  will be  independent of the Investigator \nand the Sponsor.

The Investigator will co -operate with the \nMonitor to ensure that any discrepancies that may be identified as  resolved. The Investigator is \nexpected to be able to meet the Monitor during these visits. When the first patient is allocated to \ntreatment at the trial site, a monitoring visit will take place shortly afterwards. For this trial, the frequency of the monitoring visits is intended to be approximately every 6 -8 weeks. Frequent \nmonitoring is expected when new patients have been included; thereafter there may be longer \nintervals between the visits. The frequency of monitoring is also dependent on the number of \npatients at each trial site.  \nOne hundred percent  SDV will be performed. The SDV process and definition of key variables to \nbe monitored will be described in detail in the Monitor's Plan for the trial.  \n11.2 Audit and Inspection  \nThe Investigator  will make all the trial- related source data an d records available at any time to \nquality assurance auditor(s) mandated by the Sponsor , or CRO,  or to domestic/foreign regulatory \ninspectors or representatives from IECs who may audit/inspect the trial.  \nThe main purposes of an audit or inspection are to a ssess compliance with the trial protocol and the \nprinciples of ICH -GCP including the Declaration of Helsinki and all other relevant regulations. \nThe patient s must be informed by the Investigator  and in the Informed Consent Documents that \nauthorised Sponsor  representatives and representatives from regulatory authorities and IECs may \nwish to inspect their medical records.

If the \npatient undergoes bowel preparation for endoscopy during any of these 5 days , the rectal bleeding \nsubscore for those day(s) should be considered missing. In addition, the  rectal bleeding subscore \nwill be c onsidered missing  for the day of all endoscopies and the day after. The daily score for \nrectal bleeding will be calcula ted for all the days until the EoT  Visit. \nFurthermore, for e ach day after  Visit 4, the change in the daily subscore for rectal bleeding from the \nmost recent visit will be calculated. This change will be referred to as the delta in the daily subscore \nfor rectal bleeding for that day.  \nExamples:  \n\u2022 Assume that for a pat ient, Day 30 is between Visit 4 and Visit 5 , then the delta in the daily \nscore for rectal bleeding at the Day 30 will be calculated as the change in the daily score for rectal bleeding  at Day 30 from the daily score for rectal bleeding  at Visit 4 (see Sect ion \n7.1.1).  \n\u2022 Assume that for a patient , Day 52 is between Visit 5 and Visit 6 , then the delta in the daily \nscore for rectal bleeding at the Day 52 will be calculated as the change in the daily score fo r \nrectal bleeding  at Day 52 from the daily score for rectal bleeding at Visit 5.     \nWorsening will be defined as an increase from last visit in Mayo rectal bleeding subscore \u22651, over \n3 consecutive days . Such a worsening shoul d be evaluated by the I nvestigator and confirmed by \nendoscop y (no improvement or worse ) prior to decision for withdrawal of patient.   ",

INTRODUCTION\n1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND\nIdiopathic Pulmonary  Fibrosis (I PF) is a chronic disease of unknown aetiology  that is \ncharacterized by progressive fibrotic destruction of the lung, resulting in disabling dyspnoea\nand poor gas exchange. The average life expectancy  in IPF patients is 2- 3 years. \nThe only  drug that has been registered in a number of countries for the treatment of I PF is\npirfenidone. It was launched in Japan in 2008 under the brand name Pirespa\u00aeand was \napproved for the treatme nt of mild -to-moderate IPF in Europe and Canada in 2011 (under the \nbrand name Esbriet\u00ae). Following the successful completion of a third Phase III tr ial (PIPF -\n016, ASCEND) pirfenidone was recentl y approved by the US FDA for the treatment of IPF. \nOther pharmacologic options include corticosteroids, azathioprine, cy clophosphamide, and \nN-acety l cysteine, albeit none of these has been proven efficacious in clinical trials compared \nwith placebo, and none is indicated for the treatment of I PF. Thus, despite the availability  of \npirfenidone and the possibility  of lung transplantation, the medical need for efficacious and \nsafe treatment of IPF remains high.\nNintedanib has been developed for the treatment of I PF and for several cancer t ypes in two \nseparate clinical development programmes. \nIn IPF the clinical proof of concept for nintedanib was established in the 52 -week phase II \ntrial 1199.30 ( P11-11216) . Based on this trial, it was considered that nintedanib may  confer \nclinical benefit to patients with I PF with acceptable safet y.\nTwo phase III international, double -blind, placebo -controlled trials of identical study  design \n1199.32 and 1199.34 confirmed the efficacy  and safet y of nintedanib 150 mg bid versus \nplacebo in patients with IPF (P14-\n07514) (refer to Section 1.2). Based on the overall \nevidence, nintedanib was approved b y the US FDA for the treatment of IPF in October 2014. \nThe current study 1199.33 is a long -term extension study  of the Phase III trials and such it is \nconducted to evaluate the long- term safet y and tolerability  of nintedanib in IPF.  \n1.2 DRUG PROFILE\nNintedanib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the Platelet Derived Growth \nFactor Receptor (PDGFR) \u03b1 and \u03b2, Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) 1 -3, and \nVascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR). Nintedanib binds competitively  to \nthe ATP binding pocket of these receptors and blocks the intracellular signalling which is \ncrucial for the proliferation, migration, and transformation of fibroblasts, representing \nessential mechanisms of the I PF pathology . In addition, nintedanib inhibits Flt -3, Lck, Ly n, \nand Src kinases ( U07-1248 ).\nNintedanib is currentl y in clinical development for several ty pes of cancer. In line with the \npre-clinical findings, the clinical development programme has provided data suggesting that ",

Furthermore, V EGF Rinhibition may  also have favourable effects, \nalthough the precise role of down -regulation of VEGF -mediated actions in I PF has not y et \nbeen full y elucidated (R07-0002) . Oral administration of nintedanib to rats with bleomy cin-\ninduced lung fibrosis resulted in nearl y complete attenuation of fibrosis histologicall y not \nonly when started at day  1 after bleom ycin administration, but also when administered only \nfrom day  10 to 21. In this model, nintedanib thus may  be acting directl y against the fibrotic \nprocesses, rather than solely  through inhibition of inflammation.\nA soft gelatin capsule formulation of nintedanib is used in humans. After oral administration, \nnintedanib was absorbed moderatel y fast. Maximum plasma concentrations ( Cmax) occurred 1 \nto 4 hours after administration. Steady  state was reached within 9 day s of treatment at the \nlatest. The gMean terminal half -life (t 1/2) was 18 hours after intravenous administration. The \nmajor route of elimination of total [14C] radioactivity  was via the faeces / biliary  excretion, \nwhile the contribution of renal excretion was low (0.7% of an orally  administered radioactive \ndose). An absolute bioavailability  of slightl y below 5% was observed b y an intra -individual \ncomparison of dose normali zed AUC of 100 mg nintedanib administered orally  and 6 mg \nnintedanib administered intravenousl y. The total percentage absorbed was estimated to be at \nleast 23% compared to an absolute bioavailability of the parent alone of about 5%, thereb y \nconfirming the large amount of metabolite formed during intestinal and/or hepatic first pass \nmetabolism. \nThe by  far most frequent metabolites were BIBF 1202 formed by  ester cleavage and the \nsubsequently  glucuronidation formed BIBF 1202- glucuronide. The glucuronidation o f \nBIBF 1202 was mainl y through UGT1A1 (liver and intestine) and UGT1A7, UGT1A8 and \nUGT1A10 (intestine). Drug -drug interactions based on cy tochrome P450 dependent \npathway s are not expected for \nnintedanib .\nIn vitro transporter profiling of BIBF 1120 and BIBF 1202 showed that BIBF 1120 - but not \nBIBF 1202 -is a P -gp substrate. The effect of xenobiotics interacting with P- gp is currentl y \nnot known.\nIn the IPF phase II proof -of-concept trial 1199.30, 432 patients with consistent I PF were \nrandomized, with baseline characteristics comparable across groups. The results of the \nprimary  endpoint analyses, annual rate of FVC decline, were: 0.19 L (placebo); 0.17 L  (50 \nmg qd); 0.21 L (50 mg bid); 0.16 L  (100 mg bid); and 0.06 L (150 mg bid: -68% reduction in \nrate of dec line vs. placebo, p=0.0136; closed -testing multiplicity  corrected: p=0.0639). At \nend of study , FVC% pred was better preserved in the 100 mg bid (p=0.0314) and 150 mg bid \n(p=0.0002) groups when compared to placebo. FVC signal robustness was supported b y \nresults of body  plethy smography  and ox ygen saturation. Compared to placebo, fewer patients \nhad acute exacerbations in the 150 mg bid group (p=0.0150), and there were a greater number \nof SGRQ 4-point scale responders in the 100 mg bid (p=0.0069) and 150 mg bid (p=0.0341) \ngroups.  No effect was observed on DL COand 6 -MWT. The number of deaths was not ",

Discontinuations (26.2%; 22.4% due to AE) were \nmore frequent with 150 mg bid (37.6%; 31.8%), but less with 100 mg bid (16.3% ; 15.1%), \ncompared to placebo (28.2%; 24.7%).\nThe adverse events most frequentl y leading to discontinuation were diarrhoea, nausea, and \nvomiting (in the group receiving 150 mg twice a day as compared with those receiving \nplacebo, the respective rates were 11.8% vs. 0%, 4.7% vs. 0%, and 2.4% vs. 1.2%). Among \nthe 85 patients in the group receiving 150 mg of the study  drug twice a day , 4 (4.7%) had \nserious gastrointestinal events and 5 (5.9%) had severe gastrointestinal events, especiall y \ndiarrhoea, as compare d with no patients in the placebo group.\nClinically  significant elevations in liver enzy mes levels (at least three times the upper limit of \nthe normal range for ALT or AST at an y time after baseline) were observed in 6 patients in \nthe group receiving 150 m g of nintedanib twice a day  (7.1%), 1 in the group receiving 100 \nmg twice a day  and none in the placebo group. All aminotransferase levels normalized or \ndecreased from elevated levels with continued treatment (in 3 patients receiving 150 mg \ntwice a day  and 1 patient receiving 100 mg twice a day ), with a dose reduction (from 150 mg \ntwice a day  to 100 mg twice a day  in 1 patient), or with withdrawal of the drug (in 2 patients \nreceiving 150 mg twice a day ). \nFor patients of the Phase II study  participation in the open label rollover trial 1199.35 was \noffered. This study  is currently  ongoing. \nOverall, it was considered that nintedanib may  confer clinical benefit to patients with I PF \nwith an acceptable safet y profile. The benefit/risk assessment of the Phase II trial results \njustified initiation of 2 large Ph ase III trials. Trials 1199.32 ( U13-2381-01) and 1199.34 \n(U13-2382 -01), which are the parent trials of the current 1199.33 trial, evaluated the safet y \nandefficacy  of the 150 mgbid dose versus placebo when given over 52 weeks. \nIn total 515 patients were randomised in study  1199.32 and 551 patients in study  1199.34. \nThe primary  endpoint of the annual rate of decline in FVC was met in both studies. I n stud y \n1199.32 the adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC was - 239.91 mL /year in the placebo \ngroup and - 114.65 mL/ year in the nintedanib group. The difference between treatment groups \nwas 125.26 mL /year (95% CI : 77.68, 172.84) and was statistically significant (p<0.0001). In \nstudy  1199.34 the adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC was -207.32 mL/y ear in the placebo \ngroup and - 113.59 mL/ year in the nintedanib group. The difference between the treatment \ngroups was 93.73 mL /year (95% CI: 44.78, 142.68) and was stat isticall y significant \n(p=0.0002). \nChange from baseline in SGRQ total score at 52 weeks was a key  secondary  endpoint in the \nstudies. I n study  1199.32 there was a small difference between the treatment groups in favo ur \nof nintedanib: -0.05 (95% CI : - 2.40, 2.50), which was not statistically  significant (p=0.966). \nIn stud y 1199.34 the difference between the treatment groups was -2.69 (95% CI :-4.95, -\n0.43) in favour of nintedanib and was statisticall y significant (p=0.0197).",

I n study  1199.32 there was no difference between the treatment groups and the \nhazard ratio (HR) was 1.15 (95% CI : 0.54, 2.42; p=0.673). In study  1199.34 the risk of  \nhaving a first acute IPF exacerbation was significantly  lower in the nintedanib group than in \nthe placebo group, with a HR of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.77; p=0.005).\nIn both studies, survival endpoints showed a consistent numerical difference in favour of \nnintedanib. The HR for time to de ath over 52 weeks in a pre -specified pooled anal ysis of both \nstudies was 0.70 (95% CI 0.43, 1.12; p = 0.1399).\nAs expected, the most frequent AEs were gastrointestinal disorders.

RATIONALE, OBJECTIVE S, AND BENEFIT - RISK \nASSESSMENT\n2.1 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE T RIAL\nThe aim of this extension trial is to provide nintedanib treatment for all patients who have \ncompleted one year treatment and the follow up peri od in the double -blind phase III placebo \ncontrolled parent trial s (1199.32 and 1199.34), who may have experienced benefit from the \nstudy  medication and wish to \nreceive treatment .\nMoreover it is designed to determine the tolerability  and safet y of nintedanib and to follow up \non survival in I PF patients treated for a long period.\nThroughout this protocol, each time \u201cparent trial\u201d is quoted it refers to the 1199.32 and \n1199.34 trials (EudraCT no. 2010\n-024251- 87 and no. 2010 -024252- 29).\n2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES\nThe primar y objective is to assess long term safet y of treatment with oral nintedanib in \npatients with I diopathic Pulmonary  Fibrosis (I PF).\nPlease refer to Section 5 for a detailed description of the trial endpoints.\n2.3 BENEFIT - RISK ASSE SSMENT\nNintedanib has shown robust, reproducible, statistically  significant, and clinically  meaningful \neffects on the decline in lung function a s measured by  FVC. In two large, international, \nplacebo\n-controlled phase III trials of identical design, ninteda nib 150 mg bid statistically  and \nclinically  significantl y reduced the annual rate of decline in FVC over 52 weeks compared \nwith placebo indicating a relative difference of approximately  50% between nintedanib and \nplacebo. T his effect of nintedanib is consi dered c onsistent with slowing disease progression \nas measured b y FVC.\nThe risks of treatment with nintedanib are primarily related to the gastrointestinal tract \n(nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain) and to increases in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, \nALK P, gamma -GT) and bilirubin. Also weight decrease and decreased appetite have \nfrequentl y been reported in studies with nintedanib. Moreover, based on experience with \nother ty rosine kinase inhibitors, impairment of immune and of kidney function, intestinal \nperforations, increases in blood pressure as well as potential bleeding and thrombotic events\nshould be carefully  monitored and evaluated in clinical trials. In patients who develop severe\nsymptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity  not amenable to sy mptomatic tr\neatment with standard\nmeasures, severe liver enzy me elevations, severe drug -related infections, or uncontrolled\nhypertension, treatment with nintedanib must be discontinued and appropriate therapeutic\nmeasures taken (refer to Section 4.2.1.1) . Liver enzy mes must be followed closely  during \ntreatment with nintedanib.",

I n additio n, nintedanib may  reduce the \nrisk of acute IPF exacerbations and worsening of patient \u2019s quality  of life. Finally , nintedanib\nmay ultimatel y be found to reduce mortality . Overall, the benefit/risk profile of nintedanib, as \nestablished during the phase II and III trials is interpreted as favourable for the treatment o f \nIPF\n.\nAlthough rare, a potential for drug -induced liver injury  is under constant surveillance by  \nsponsors and regulators. Therefore, this study  requires timely  detection, evaluation, and \nfollow -up of laboratory  alterations of selected liver laboratory  parameters to ensure patients\u2019 \nsafet y.\nPatients who are offered to enter this open label extension trial mus t have participated in a \nphase III parent trial (1199.32 or 1199.34) for one y ear. All pat ients will be treated with \nactive drug. Patients who have not tolerated the blinded study  drug or discontinued for any  \nreason are not eligibl e for the extension trial. P atients who were randomized to placebo in the \nparent trial will be receiving the active drug for the first time. Similar safety monitoring\nprocedures as in the phase III trials will be applied .\nThe routine safet y monitoring established in the parent study  is considered appropriate for the \nlong term \nfollow -up of the patients. It consists of regular visits to the investigational site, \nblood analy ses and specific monitoring procedures to follow -up potential hepatic enz yme \nelevation. In case it is considered adequate b y the i nvestigator, the dose of nintedanib may be \nreduced to 100 mg bid or dosing may  be interrupted.",

The decision to continue treatment will be made by the patient following a \ndiscussion with the investigator. The aim of the study  is to allow treatment continuation to \nindividual patients; therefore, randomization, blinding and use of placebo would not be \nappropriate. \nTo obtain information on the lo ng term safet y and tolerability of \nnintedanib , adverse events\nand acute IPFexacerbations will be reported ,andclinical labor atory  tests, electrocardiograms\nand lung function tests will be performed. FVC derived endpoints will be assessed and data\non disc ontinuations and death will be recorded.\n",
